                                                SNAKE GAME IN JAVA
                                                -------------------

1.  FIRSTLY MAKE THE FRAME  OF FIXED SIZE.

2.  AND THE GAME PANEL WHERE ALL THE WORKS IS DONE

3.  AND AT LAST IMPLEMENTATION OF FRAME .

  THE GAME PANEL CONTAINS
  ========================

--->  SCREEN WIDTH, HEIGHT AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THE UNIT SIZE
                       ALMOST ALL THE PORTION OF THE GAME IS DEPENDENT IN THIS HEIGHT WIDTH AND UNIT SIZE.
                  THEN WE MOVE TOWARD THE BODY PART OF THE SNAKE WHICH CAN BE INITIALIZED FROM 1 TO INFINITY
                   IT DEPEND ON HOW LONG SNAKE YOU WANT TO START WITH.

---> THE  APPLES WHICH IS EATEN BY AND THE X,Y COMPONENT OF THAT APPLE IS ALSO DECLARED FOLLOWED BY THE DIRECTIONS
                 IN WHICH THE SNAKE CAN MOVE AND EAT THE APPLES.

---> FOR THE BODY OF THE SNAKE WE USE GRAPHICS TO IMPLEMENT THE COLORS TO BE FILLED IN THE
             BODY PORTION OF THE SNAKE.

---> WE USE THE TIMER, AND RANDOM FUNCTION TO RUN THE SNAKE AND GENERATE THE APPLES AT RANDOM PLACE
           WHICH IS EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND ALSO THE EATEN PART IS ADDED TO THE BODY OF THE SNAKE .

---> WE USE THE KEY-ADAPTER IN THIS GAME FOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE SNAKE FROM THE KEYWORD.
               KEY-EVENTS FOR THE MOVEMENT-->(RIGHT,LEFT ,UP,DOWN)

---> AT LAST WE BOUND THE X, Y COMPONENT OF THE FRAME SO THAT WHEN THE SNAKE TOUCHES
                THE BOUNDARY OF THE FRAME THE GAME GETS OVER.
